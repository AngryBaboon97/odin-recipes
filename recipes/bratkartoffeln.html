    <h1>Bratkartoffeln (German Cottage Fries) Recipe</h1>
    
    <p>One of my longtime favorite recipes to whip up for a big dinner party, wrap up in a casserole dish to bring to friends, or bake up on a regular old weeknight here with just the three of us — say hello to my favorite beef enchiladas! ♡</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds waxy potatoes (red or yellow))</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 large yellow or white onion, diced</li>
        <li>6 slices (6 to 7 ounces) bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Boil the potatoes:</b> 
            After scrubbing the potatoes, add them to a large pot of cold water. 
            Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cook for about 10 minutes, then test with a paring knife; the knife should easily poke through to the center of the potato without too much effort. </li>
        <li><b>Fry the potatoes:</b>
            Add the oil to a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add as many of the potatoes as you can in an even layer and let cook on one side until golden brown, 4 to 7 minutes. 
            Flip them and let cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Remove the golden brown potatoes onto a large plate and cook the remaining potatoes until they’re all crisp on both sides, adding more oil to the pan as needed.</li>
        <li><b>Finish and serve:</b>
            Add the cooked potatoes back into the pan and add the onion, bacon, and butter. 
            Season with salt and pepper and let cook until the onions are softened and the bacon is slightly crisp, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
            Leftover bratkartoffeln will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Reheat in a frying pan with a little vegetable oil until hot all the way through, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
